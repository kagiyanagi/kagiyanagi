### What i like

I like to build cli/gui tools and messing around with them :}. I'm passionate about open-source development because I believe in giving back to the tools I use and helping make them better for everyone. I'm still learning, but I'm committed to growing into a skilled and impactful open-source contributor.

#### My skills and the tools i use are quite decent!
